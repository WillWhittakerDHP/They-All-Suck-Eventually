// // TODO: GET * should return the index.html file.

// // TODO: GET /api/weather/history should read the searchHistory.json file and return all saved cities as JSON.

// // TODO: POST /api/weather should receive a city name to save on the request body, add it to the searchHistory.json file, and then return associated weather data to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each city name a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).
